I have branched out this repo for project 3. Changes made for project three are:
1.  Image slider added for travel page of this repo. As such, html and css style files have been updated. Morever, a separate JS script file named slider.js has been added for behaviour modelling of travel webpage. Sliding behaviour is grabbing, not clicking. 
2. Fourth page has been added of Google maps API. An untraceable problem is causing error and the API is functioning well. However, in my offline version, the API is working just fine.
