## project2: 
I had first branched out project 1 and completed my project 2 first deliverable in project 1 branch. However, there was this pull conflict that emerged as I was finishing up my code @https://github.com/Munz1993/project1/tree/project2. So, I had to create this new separate repo for project 2 all over again. Now I got the code and I'm just rectifying the indentation issues.
